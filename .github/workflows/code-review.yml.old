# Simple natural language program for code review
When a pull request is opened or updated:

1. **Review the Python code changes** for common issues:
   - Check for hardcoded secrets or API keys
   - Look for functions that might crash (like division by zero)
   - Identify missing type hints
   - Find functions without docstrings
   - Check for magic numbers that need explanation

2. **Review the tests**:
   - Look for missing test methods
   - Identify edge cases that aren't tested
   - Check if error conditions are tested

3. **Provide helpful feedback**:
   - Comment on specific lines with issues
   - Suggest concrete improvements with examples
   - Explain why each issue matters
   - Be encouraging and educational

4. **Focus on the most important issues first**:
   - Security problems (hardcoded secrets)
   - Bugs that cause crashes
   - Missing tests for critical functions

Keep feedback simple and actionable. The goal is to help improve code quality while being educational.
